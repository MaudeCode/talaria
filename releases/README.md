# Release-set metadata

`release-set.schema.json` defines version 1 of the immutable release receipt.
Its identifier is the monorepo source SHA. Each changed component is built from
that SHA; an unchanged component retains its previous tag, artifact, source and
original release-set identifier. Versions are independent. Supported contract
versions are explicit capability sets; peers must share a capability, and the
new servers must still support the previously released App.

`release_set.py MANIFEST --previous PREVIOUS --output DESTINATION` validates the
schema and cross-field rules before writing a new file. Omit `--previous` only
for the first release set. Existing output files are never overwritten. The
previous document must come from the trusted completed-release publication.

A `candidate` records the intended App build number, locally built Web image
digest and Relay deployment target. It cannot claim a new Relay deployment or
any publication receipt. A `complete` document additionally requires successful
publication evidence for every changed component and the actual deployed Relay
revision. Unchanged components are not republished. Failed or partial runs must
remain diagnostics; changing `status` alone cannot complete them.

Evidence records identify successful workflow gates and their exact source.
JSON validation checks consistency, not whether a remote job actually ran.
Only the trusted root workflow may assemble and publish the completed receipt
from its own successful jobs. Never use an operator-authored JSON receipt as
authorization to deploy or upload.

The Web image digest is the registry manifest digest, not a mutable tag or Docker
config/image ID. Agent identity contains its exact version and immutable source
SHA or published image digest (or both). It is an external dependency, not a
fourth component. The App marketing version and build number, Web image digest,
and Relay source/deployment identity are the rollback inputs.

Run `scripts/check-releases` for isolated synthetic validation. It installs the
pinned release-tool dependencies in a disposable virtual environment and
requires no accounts, credentials, tags or running services.
