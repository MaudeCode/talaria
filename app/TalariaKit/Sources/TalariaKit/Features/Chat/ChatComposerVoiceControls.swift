/// The composer mic. A quick **tap** toggles on-device dictation (unchanged); a
/// **press-and-hold** records a server-transcribed voice note, releasing to send
/// and sliding up to cancel. Both paths run through a single
/// `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)`: touch-down schedules a `DispatchWorkItem`
/// after the hold threshold, and a release before it fires cancels the item and
/// counts as a tap → dictation. See `pressGesture` for why timing beats composing
/// `LongPressGesture`/`TapGesture`.

/// Telegram-style indicator shown above the composer while a voice note records:
/// a pulsing red dot, an `m:ss` timer, and a slide-to-cancel hint that turns red
/// once the cancel threshold is armed. Exposes explicit VoiceOver actions because
/// the hold-to-talk gesture isn't reachable with VoiceOver on.
